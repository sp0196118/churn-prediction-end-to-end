# Customer Churn Prediction — End-to-End Project

### 👤 Author: Sachin Patel

This project predicts which telecom customers are likely to leave the service
(churn) so businesses can take preventive actions.

I focused on:

- Understanding the problem from a business perspective
- Clean and reproducible data pipeline
- Model performance + model interpretability
- Clear documentation

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Telecom companies lose a significant amount of money when customers leave.
The goal is to identify customers who may churn so the business can:

- Provide discounts
- Improve support
- Reduce revenue loss
